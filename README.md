TODO:

    - show ranks and files on board (a,b,c..//1,2,3..)
    - unique users stats
    - timer
    - move log
    - showcase pieces captured
    - drag and drop


NOTES:

    - Launch Chess.exe to play
    - "Chess Logic" directory contains a working chess but with neither pre-game GUI nor end-game.
        You can ignore it; no need to download it.

following (for logic ideas and bug fixes):
