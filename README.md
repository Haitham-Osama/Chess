TODO:
    - show ranks and files on board (a,b,c..//1,2,3..)
    - unique users stats
    - timer
    - move log
    - showcase pieces captured
    - drag and drop


NOTES:
    - Launch Chess.exe to play
    - "Chess Logic" directory contains a working chess but with neither pre-game GUI nor end-game. You can ignore it; no need to download it.
